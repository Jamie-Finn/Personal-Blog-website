			<p>Hi there my name is Jamie Finn aged 23 and I am a PHP Developer currently looking for full-time work.</p>
			<p>I have recently graduated from Manchester Metropolitan University in July 2014 with a 2:2 in Web Development. Overall I enjoyed the university experience but found the course title a little misleading as other subjects/units were included along with Web Development. These included topics like business, newspapers and media law just to name a few. While these were at times interesting and relevant to the Web in terms of the content and Internet laws I always felt before I started attending University that I would be spending most of my time in lectures and seminars actually working on developing websites and learning more about them specifically and not have to do different compulsory units.</p>
			<p>I grew up in Stoke-on-Trent. It's not the prettiest of places but it is my home so you have to have some pride for where you come from right? but having lived in Manchester for a couple of years I soon realised how far behind Stoke is when compared to other cities.</p>
			<p>In terms of Web Development skills they are generally based in the Back-end side such as PHP/Object-Oriented PHP, MySQL, and MVC frameworks like Laravel. I also have experience of using Linux/Ubuntu on a hosted web server and in a local/virtual environment with Laravel Homestead. I hope to start off my development career as a PHP developer and to further improve my range of skill and knowledge in the field.</p>
			<p>I have also obtained Front-end skills in HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript, jQuery and have touched upon AJAX, JSON and XML as they can be also used in relation with PHP.</p>
			<p>My text editor of choice is Sublime Text and the devices I use are a Windows Desktop and Laptop(both Acer brands).</p>
			<p>My personal interests are of course all things Web-related, sports(Manchester United), gaming and playing the guitar.</p>
			<p>I hope you enjoy reading my blog!</p>
